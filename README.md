# Z shell Configuration

# Install

First, create a backup of your current setup:

```bash
$ mv ~/.zsh ~/.zsh.old
$ mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.old
```

Then, clone this repository and apply settings:

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/otaviocc/zsh-config.git
$ mv zsh-config ~/.zsh
$ ln -s ~/.zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

Finally, open a new terminal to apply the new settings.
